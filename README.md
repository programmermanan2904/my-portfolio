## üöÄ About The Project

This portfolio is built from scratch using fundamental web technologies. The goal was to create a fast, professional, and easily maintainable site to serve as a central hub for my work and contact information.

Key features include:
* **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
* **Project Showcase:** A dedicated section to display my key projects with links to live demos and source code.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented with JavaScript for a seamless user experience when navigating between sections.
* **Interactive Elements:** Subtle hover effects and animations to make the site feel dynamic.
* **Clear Call-to-Actions:** Easy access to my professional profiles and email.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using the following technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For interactivity and DOM manipulation (no frameworks).
* **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons.

## üîß Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-github-username]/[your-repo-name].git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Customize

You can easily customize this portfolio to make it your own.

1.  **Content (`index.html`):**
    * Open `index.html` in a code editor.
    * Change the name in the `<title>` tag and navigation bar.
    * Replace the text in the "Hero" and "About Me" sections with your own information.
    * Update the "Projects" section: replace placeholder images, titles, descriptions, and links.
    * Update the "Contact" section with your email and links to your LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

2.  **Styling (`style.css`):**
    * Open `style.css`.
    * To change the main color scheme, simply update the CSS variables in the `:root` block at the top of the file.
    * ```css
      :root {
          --primary-color: #007BFF; /* Change this for the main theme color */
          --secondary-color: #343a40;
          --background-color: #f8f9fa;
      }
      ```

3.  **Images:**
    * Replace the hero background image in `style.css` (in the `.hero` class).
    * Replace the project placeholder images in `index.html`. It's best practice to create an `images` folder to store your `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, etc.

## üöÄ Deployment

You can host this website for free using **GitHub Pages**.

1.  Push your customized code to a public GitHub repository.
2.  In your repository, go to `Settings` > `Pages`.
3.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, select `Deploy from a branch`.
4.  Choose the `main` (or `master`) branch as the source and click `Save`.
5.  Your website will be live at `https://[your-github-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]/` in a few minutes.
